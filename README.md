**WebMonitor** is a comprehensive website monitoring solution that tracks uptime, SSL certificates, SEO health, and performance metrics. Perfect for developers, businesses, and individuals who want complete visibility into their web services.

## � Why I Built This

As a developer managing multiple websites and projects, I faced several recurring pain points:

* **Unexpected Downtime** - Finding out my site was down only after users complained
* **SSL Certificate Expiry** - Certificates expiring without warning, causing security errors
* **SEO Blind Spots** - Not knowing about missing meta tags or broken heading structures until rankings dropped
* **Manual Checking** - Wasting time manually visiting each site to verify it's working

I wanted a single dashboard where I could see the health of all my websites at a glance—without paying for expensive monitoring services.

## 🎯 Problems This Solves

| Problem | Solution |

| "Is my SEO configured correctly?" | Automated SEO analysis detecting common issues |
| "I missed knowing my site was down" | Email notifications when sites go offline |
| "I want to try before signing up" | Anonymous guest access with visitor tokens |

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Python Workers (Scheduled Jobs)                        │
│  • Health Check Worker (uptime, response time)         │
│  • SSL Validator (certificate expiry)                  │
│  • SEO Analyzer (metadata audits)                      │
